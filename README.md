# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation whilst completing this project was to make a easy access study guide of notes for everyhting I learned in the pre work modules. I built this project to really dip my foot into not only just reading andd writing code but applying it and understanding how it works. I feel like it helps me because I was able to put all my notes in one place as well as put them into practice throughout the whole thing, which really solidified the things I was taught across all the topics. I learned how to code in HTML to make a website, style the website using a styling sheet in CSS, make the website interactive in devTools on the console with JavaScript as well as transfer all of my work and edits online to my portfolio aka Github repo.
